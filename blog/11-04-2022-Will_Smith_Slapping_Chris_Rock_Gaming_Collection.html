			<!-- <p class="content_description">As gorgeous as Elden Ring is, few would describe it as cute. Hold up, though, because if you apply a tilt shift effect to the Lands Between and view it isometrically, it actually does look kinda cute. Weird, but true.
				YouTuber Flurdeh specializes in presenting the strange beauty of game worlds on their channel, and the latest video on Elden Ring is a special one. With an adjustment to the point of view, and the simulation of a tilt-shift lense—which tweaks the depth-of-field and various
				other qualities to achieve a miniature model effect—Elden Ring begins to resemble a dreamy CRPG, rather than the oppressive and dangerous game we've actually played.
